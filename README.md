#  100 Days of Web Development Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Web Development** challenge repository!

In this repository, I document my daily progress as I learn **web development from scratch**.  
The goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation by practicing **consistently for 100 days**, focusing on both understanding concepts and writing clean code.

Each day contains:
- A specific topic
- Hands-on coding practice
- Simple and structured examples

This repository will be updated **daily** as I continue my learning journey.
